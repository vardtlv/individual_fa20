    "Parks and recreation services are meant to serve communities by providing them with an outlet for physical activites, group activites, and places for congregation. However, it has been shown that there can be disparities in park distribution and access among neighborhoods based on income or race/ethnicity<sup>1</sup>. The study done by the National Recreation and Park Association (NPRA) investigates this disparity throughout multiple cities in America, but has not conducted a study in San Diego. \n",

    "Physical health is an important factor into overall the wellbeing of a person, however, a lack of resources to maintain physical health will hinder this. Local parks and recreation facilities can offer individuals many resources to stay active and maintain their physical health. Just by taking a walk in the park, a person can \"help to maintain their weight, strengthen their muscles and bones, and improve balance and coordination<sup>2</sup>\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Jim Sallis, the director of Active Living Research at SDSU has stated how “many low-income communities lack access to parks, recreation areas and sources of healthy foods[...] and those factors play a significant role in preventing participation in outdoor activity in their communities<sup>3</sup>” This decrease in outdoor activity could then lead to a decrease in physical health, as it has been shown how outdoor activites like walks are proven to be beneficial<sup>2</sup>. \n",
    "\n",
    "My study aims to research the number of parks and recreational programs that are available to differing neighborhoods in San Diego, and to find a discrepancy between low-income neighborhoods and non-low-income neighborhoods. I will also look into the physical wellbeing of those in low-income neighborhoods compared to non-low-income neighborhoods.\n",
